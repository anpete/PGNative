# PGNative

## Setup Instructions

- Install Postgres DB 10 - https://www.postgresql.org/download
- Use pgAdmin or similar to create the test database. SQL is [here](https://github.com/anpete/PGNative/blob/master/PGNative/DB.sql)
- Ensure libpq is available. On Windows, this file is in %programfiles%\PostgreSQL\10\bin, and adding this directory to the machine path is sufficient.
